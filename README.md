### To run the app correctly : 
##### PROJECT CAN BE RUN ONLY ON LINUX 
The project is already compiled into 'main' file, and the client that you need is bundled into '.html' file. 
Source code is in : 
* main.c 
* addon.c
* httplib.h

Therefore either you can clone the whole repository or just download 'main' and 'index.html' into one directory.
